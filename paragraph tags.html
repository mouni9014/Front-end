    <p>HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the foundational language used to create and structure content on the web. It provides the basic framework for building web pages by using a series of elements and tags to define headings, paragraphs, links, images, and other types of content. HTML is essential for web development as it enables browsers to interpret and render content correctly.</p>
    <p>An HTML document is composed of several key elements that work together to create a complete web page. The document begins with a `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration, followed by the `<html>` element which encloses all other content. Inside the `<html>` element, the `<head>` section contains metadata and links to external resources like stylesheets, while the `<body>` section includes the content visible to users, such as text, images, and interactive elements.</p>
    <p>HTML uses tags to create elements on a webpage. Tags are enclosed in angle brackets and typically come in pairs: an opening tag and a closing tag. For example, the `<p>` tag is used to define a paragraph, while the `</p>` tag closes it. Tags can also include attributes that provide additional information about the element, such as the `href` attribute in a `<a>` tag which specifies the URL for a hyperlink.</p>
